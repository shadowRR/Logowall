# Wallpaper from code / text

Small project, to automatically generate a wall from code (or any minified text).
Text color changes depending on the loaded logo.

Ex:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadowRR/wallpaper-with-code/master/img/tux_logo_code_wallpaper.png "Code Wallpaper with Tux Logo")
